Hello everyone!

I developed this code as a personal study in Python. I implemented the lines with the goal of analyzing how Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Design Patterns work together in the Python language. This is just a personal lesson I created.

If anyone would like to test it, it's available for download."
